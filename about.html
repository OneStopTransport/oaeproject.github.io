            <h4>Leadership Position within Higher Education</h4>
            <p>
            As the era of downloading and installing software shifts toward utilizing cloud-based services the traditional concepts of open source and the underlying open source communities that produce software is also shifting, in some cases quite dramatically.  As a result of this shift, higher education has seen the emergence of new “cloud-based” open source models such as KualiCo and Instructure/Canvas which have commercial companies leading software development as well as hosting cloud-based services using that software.  Although technically still “open source” as they release most of their code under open licenses, in these models the commercial entities have opted to not release key pieces of their systems as means to place barriers to others deploying and hosting on their own.  For example, in both the case of KualiCo and Instructure, code related to running multi-tenant systems, which is crucial if you wish to host a cloud service yourself, are not released under open licenses.</p>

            <p>The OAE project, which is similar to the prior examples in that it too is developing software that is architected to be deployed as a cloud-based service, has very intentionally adopted a distinctly different model which is 100% open.  More specifically, the OAE Stakeholders group which governs the project has committed to the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>release 100% of the code under an open license through a non-profit foundation (Apereo)</li>
                <li>allow and assist others who wish to host OAE themselves;</li>
                <li>give institutions complete ownership and control over their own data;</li>
                <li>support the exporting and importing of OAE content to facilitate migrations;</li>
                <li>and not prevent or charge a fee to third-parties who wish to build new OAE capabilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Current Project Status</h4>
            <p>Early in the project it was clear that given our interest in engaging in a shared services model that it would be important to deploy OAE in a hosting environment.  Various options were considered, including at Marist or other institutional partners, but the Stakeholders Group ultimately decided to use a commercial data center based in Amsterdam.  This decision was driven primarily by the fact that recent European Union laws and EU institutional policies require such systems to be hosted outside of the United States and beyond the reaches of the US Patriot Act.  This initial deployment of OAE supported smaller-scale pilots but as the project matured it became necessary to provide a more production-ready service, which we are now calling Unity, which other institutions could begin to use.  As initial work on this production-level service started, a company called “*Research”, a 70-person UK-based organization that provides grant funding information to researchers, asked to join the Stakeholder Group and offered to contribute staff and resources to help run the Unity service which they also plan to promote and provide to their current research clients.  *Research is now in the process of starting to support Unity operations for the project, freeing up the Dev/Ops team to engage in future development work.</p>

            <p>Although work remains to fully launch the Unity service, the Stakeholder Group has committed to providing free access to individuals (faculty, researchers, students, etc.) and charging institutions only what it costs to run the service plus an additional 20% that would be returned to the Stakeholders Group.  This approach will create a sustainable revenue model for the project that will be used to support and accelerate development work.  It is worth noting that the Stakeholders have agreed that if in the future there is a surplus of funds that they can be returned to Stakeholders to help them recover prior investments or generate new revenue for the institution.  In addition, the Stakeholders have committed to allowing other organizations to host and sell OAE as a cloud-based service.  A case in point is the ESUP Consortium, an open-source higher education organization in France, which is a member of the Stakeholders Group but who have opted to host OAE in France to support a national higher education collaboration platform.</p>

            <p>At present, OAE has reached what is referred to in agile development methodology as “Minimal Viable Product” or MVP status.  This means that we believe it has the minimum capabilities needed to support basic academic collaboration but may be lacking more advanced or nuanced features.  Now that the project has reached this stage we are shifting our strategic focus to increasing adoption and usage as means to inform the next phase of development work.  At the same time, such growth in usage will help create the critical mass of users needed to begin to realize value from the “networking effect”.  Such a networking effect is what has made other collaboration platforms, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, so valuable and thus is a primary strategic objective for the project at the moment.</p>

            <h4>Future Strategic Opportunities</h4>
            <p>As OAE moves into this next phase of the project it will provide Marist with a number of strategically valuable opportunities ranging from positioning the institution as an international technology leader to generating new revenue streams.  In addition to positioning us at the forefront of both modern cloud-based technologies and related new open source shared services models, there is increasing interest in using the OAE platform to build out the next generation digital learning environment.  Although such an effort would be a large-scale undertaking that would span multiple years, the Sakai community is actively exploring this concept and may seek grant funding to help support it.  In addition to these leadership opportunities, new revenue streams could be realized from a range of OAE-related activities.  This includes hosting OAE as a service for our clients, developing new tools that integrate with OAE, and providing consulting services around system integration and deployment.  From an institutional perspective, there is interest in building on the successful FOLD initiative by using OAE to support an online community for all of our distance education students.
