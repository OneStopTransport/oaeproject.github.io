      <strong>The benefits of being a stakeholder</strong>
      <p>
        The OAE project, which is similar to the prior examples in that it too is developing software that is architected to be deployed as a cloud-based service, has very intentionally adopted a distinctly different model which is 100% open.  More specifically, the OAE Stakeholders group which governs the project has committed to the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>release 100% of the code under an open license through a non-profit foundation (Apereo)</li>
        <li>allow and assist others who wish to host OAE themselves;</li>
        <li>give institutions complete ownership and control over their own data;</li>
        <li>support the exporting and importing of OAE content to facilitate migrations;</li>
        <li>and not prevent or charge a fee to third-parties who wish to build new OAE capabilities.</li>
      </ul>
