<p>Last week, the Apereo OAE project had the opportunity to do 2 project update presentations during the <a href="https://www.esup-portail.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=346554426" target="_blank">17th ESUP days and Apereo Europe event</a>, which was organized on the campus of the Paris Descartes University in Paris, France. This project update includes an overview of recent features and releases, a demo of the latest release, an overview of some of the upcoming features, as well as an update on the network of tenants that is starting to arise. A video of the presentation and the slides can be found below.</p><p>A big thanks goes to Alain Mayeur and his team for organizing this wonderful event.<br /><br /></p><p><iframe style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px 1px 0; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/31025495" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" width="840" height="700"></iframe></p><p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8IeMf_-GpX8" frameborder="0" width="840" height="630"></iframe></p>
