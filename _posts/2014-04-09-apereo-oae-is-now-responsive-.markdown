OAE Emperor Penguin also adds a range of usability improvements and a full Brazilian Portuguese translation.</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2><h3>Responsive UI</h3><p>An increasing number of people expect to be able to use applications on mobile and tablet devices, and Apereo OAE is not an exception. Usage statistics already show that many of our users are accessing OAE through these devices.</p><p>Apereo OAE uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> as its CSS framework. When they released their latest version, introducing support for responsive applications, it seemed like an appropriate time to make the OAE UI fully responsive. Despite using this responsive CSS framework and the fact that OAE has been designed tablet first, making the UI fully responsive has been a massive undertaking that has ended up touching most of the application.</p><p>However, we are extremely pleased with the end result and OAE now works well on a wide range of mobile and tablet devices. Whilst all OAE functionality works seamlessly on these devices, it is especially pleasant to keep track of your user and group activity feeds.</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BdeNt1F.png" alt="" width="761" height="246" /></p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Pvt7ZAg.png" alt="" width="761" height="246" /></p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uocHXFm.png" alt="" width="761" height="246" /></p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ao2TTuY.png" alt="" width="761" height="246" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Brazilian Portuguese translation</h3><p>A complete Brazilian Portuguese translation is now available for the OAE UI.
