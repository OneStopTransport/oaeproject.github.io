<p>The third <a href="/static/blog-assets/29-christmas%20progress%20report/Christmas%20Progress%20Report.pdf">Apereo OAE progress update report</a> is now available, summarising the progress that has been made against the end-of-year milestone that was set back in September. It also provides an overview of the progress that has been made since the last progress report, mostly in the areas of search, activities, preview processing and the User Interface.</p><p>The team is planning to organise a community Webinar later this month, where the implemented functionality will be demoed. An announcement will be made once a date has been chosen.</p>
