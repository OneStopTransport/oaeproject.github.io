<p>How does Apereo OAE work? OAE targets a large scale and a multi-tenant cloud-compatible deployment model, where a single installation can host multiple institutions at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>This presentation provides a very detailed overview of the overall architecture and the different components and technologies. We will take a closer look into all of the following components and how they are being used:</p><ul><li>Node.js</li><li>OAE Widgets</li><li>Apache Cassandra</li><li>ElasticSearch</li><li>Redis</li><li>Nginx</li><li>RabbitMQ</li></ul><p>We also talk about the approach used for continuous nightly performance testing and how we are validating the desired (horizontal) scalability. Details around back-end and UI unit testing, code coverage and security testing are shared as well.</p>
