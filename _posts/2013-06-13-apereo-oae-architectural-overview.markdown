<p>How does Apereo OAE work? OAE targets a large scale and a multi-tenant cloud-compatible deployment model, where a single installation can host multiple institutions at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>This presentation provides an overview of the different components and technologies that are being used, as well as details around deploying and configuring OAE and its associated running costs.&nbsp;</p><p>A summary of the approach used for continuous nightly performance testing and how we are validating the desired (horizontal) scalability is provided. Details around back-end and UI unit testing, code coverage and security testing will be shared and contribution models for service development and UI development is discussed as well.</p>
