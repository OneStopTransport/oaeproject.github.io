<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">Apereo OAE is designed as a multi-tenant platform that can be run at large scale, allowing for a single installation to support multiple institutions at the same time. OAE Phoenix is a first and important step and attempts to provide a basic, but solid foundation that can be used as the basis for many more collaborative scenarios.</p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">We'd like to invite everyone interested in Apereo OAE to get involved during these early and exciting times and help drive contributions, adoption and direction.</p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p><h2>Try it out</h2><p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px;">It is a project goal to make a community instance of Apereo OAE available for everyone to sign up to and play with or even use for real collaborations. We are currently targeting for this instance to be available by the fall, informed by the gathered production experiences.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">In the meantime, OAE Phoenix can be seen and tested at <a href="http://oae.oae-qa0.oaeproject.org/">http://oae.oae-qa0.oaeproject.org/</a>, where anyone can sign on. Note: this environment is also used for QA purposes, and will be wiped and re-deployed every night, so no data retention and some downtime is expected.</p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">The source code has been tagged with version number 0.2.0 can be downloaded from the following repositories:</p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">Back-end: <a href="https://github.com/oaeproject/Hilary/tree/0.2.0">https://github.com/oaeproject/Hilary/tree/0.2.0</a></p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">Front-end: <a href="https://github.com/oaeproject/3akai-ux/tree/0.2.0">https://github.com/oaeproject/3akai-ux/tree/0.2.0</a></p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">Documentation on how to install the system can be found at <a href="https://github.com/oaeproject/Hilary/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/oaeproject/Hilary/blob/master/README.md</a>.</p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">The repository containing all deployment scripts can be found at <a href="https://github.com/oaeproject/puppet-hilary">https://github.com/oaeproject/puppet-hilary</a>.</p><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p><h2>Get in touch</h2><p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica;"><br />The project website can be found at <a href="http://www.oaeproject.org">http://www.oaeproject.org</a>.
