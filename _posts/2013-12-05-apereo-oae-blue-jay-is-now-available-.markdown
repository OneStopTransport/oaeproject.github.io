While it produced picture-perfect previews, it had some drawbacks:</p><ul><li>Generating image-based previews takes significantly longer</li><li>Image-based previews are large in file-size, degrading the document browsing experience</li><li>Image-based previews degrade in quality as zoom level increases</li><li>Image-based previews are inaccessible to screen readers</li></ul><p>In the <strong>OAE Blue Jay</strong> release, we have replaced the image-based processor with the pdf2htmlEX Open Source project, generating high-fidelity HTML for each of the pages. This enhances previews in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Generating previews on large documents is orders of magnitude faster</li><li>Documents that are mostly text are significantly smaller in file-size</li><li>Zooming of text can be achieved natively in the browser without loss of preview quality</li><li>Accessibility improvements as the text is available in the HTML</li></ul><h3>Easy to use viewer</h3><p>These new HTML-based previews are displayed in OAE inside of our new simplified Document Previewer. This allows you to easily flip through pages, request a specific page or zoom in and out of pages.</p><p>On top of that, this new Document Previewer is also fully internationalizable and skinnable.</p><h3>Full screen reading</h3><p>It is now possible to enjoy reading documents without distraction by using the full-screen mode feature available in the new Document Previewer.</p><h3>Solid foundation</h3><p>This new Document Previewer is only a first step. It opens up the door to indexing and searching the full text of these documents, as well as allowing for annotations to be made inside of documents.</p><h2>Try it out</h2><p><strong>OAE Blue Jay</strong> can be experienced on the project's QA server at <a href="http://oae.oae-qa0.oaeproject.org" target="_blank">http://oae.oae-qa0.oaeproject.org</a>.
